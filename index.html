		<p id="bio"> My name is <em> David Sanderson</em>, I was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in the year of 1890, in the midst of the Gold Rush. Early in my life, I decided to move south and call Albuquerque, New Mexico my home. My father was a mountain man, the last of the great giants of the Rockies. My mother, on the other hand, was an adventurous mountaineer with a heart of gold. Even here, so far away from the magnificent peaks, I still hear the song of the mountains ringing in my soul.  </br></p>
